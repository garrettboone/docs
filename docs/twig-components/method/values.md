# values

`values` is a Twig filter to return all the values of an array.

Jasny's Twig Extensions can be easily installed using Composer:

```twig
composer require jasny/twig-extensions
```

###Usage

```twig
$twig = new Twig_Environment($loader, $options);
$twig->addExtension(new Jasny\Twig\ArrayExtension());
```

To use in a Symfony project register the extensions as a service:

```twig
twig.extension.array:
class: Jasny\Twig\ArrayExtension
tags:
- { name: twig.extension }
```
